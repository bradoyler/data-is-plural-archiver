http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/

Last month, Chicago’s city government published data on more than 100 million local taxi rides taken in the city since 2013. (The city gathers the data through “periodic reporting by two major payment processors believed to cover most taxis in Chicago.”) The dataset contains each ride’s start/end times, pickup/dropoff location (based on Chicago’s “community areas”), distance, cost, payment type, and taxi company. Related: “Analyzing 1.1 Billion NYC Taxi and Uber Trips, with a Vengeance,” which contains pointers to similar data for New York City. [h/t Dan Nguyen]

### Solar panels.

https://openpv.nrel.gov/index

The Open PV Project is a “community driven, comprehensive database” of solar panel installations in the U.S., ranging from home installations to utility-scale projects. The database, run by the Department of Energy, contains more than 1 million installations — with a total capacity of 16,000+ megawatts — and tracks their locations, sizes, costs, installers, and other variables.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration publishes a bunch of geographic data, including shapefiles mapping the country’s crude oil, petroleum product, hydrocarbon gas liquid, and natural gas pipelines. (They were last updated five months ago.) Additionally, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration keeps track of “significant incidents” — for example, those that caused a serious injury or $50,000 in damage. Related: “Six maps that show the anatomy of America’s vast infrastructure.” Also related: ProPublica’s Pipeline Safety Tracker, covering 1986–2012.

### Gunshot detections.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-alerts-police-to-lots-of-gunfire-but-produces-few-tangible-results

Earlier this month, Forbes published an examination of ShotSpotter, a company that uses networks of outdoor microphones to detect and locate gunshot-like sounds. Forbes found that ShotSpotter has produced “few tangible results.” “In some cities, ShotSpotter hasn’t had the effect city officials and residents had hoped for. While officers are responding to more illegal gunfire, they rarely catch the shooter.” To support its findings, Forbes has published the ShotSpotter data they received from police departments in seven cities: Brockton, Mass.; East Palo Alto, Calif.; Kansas City, Mo.; Milwaukee, Wis.; Omaha, Neb.; San Francisco, Calif.; and Wilmington, N.C. The data varies somewhat for each city, but typically includes the date, time, location, and outcome of the each gunshot alert. [h/t Matt Drange]

### What kills us.

https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html
https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html
https://wonder.cdc.gov/mortSQL.html

The CDC’s Underlying Cause of Death database provides county-level mortality statistics based on death certificates of U.S. residents for each year from 1999 to 2014. The tool lets you group the data by geography, demographics, place of death (e.g., inpatient hospital, hospice, home, etc.), and other variables. In 2014, for example, about 40,000 residents died of pancreatic cancer — with the highest rates coming in America’s most-rural counties (~15.6 deaths per 100,000 residents) and the lowest rates in country’s most-urban counties (~11.3 per 100,000). The CDC’s “compressed mortality” datasets contain slightly less detail, but go all the way back to 1968. [h/t Drew Ivan]

Earlier this month, New York City published the results of its decennial tree count. You can explore a map of every street tree in NYC — nearly 700,000 of ‘em — or download the corresponding dataset, which contains info on each tree’s species, circumference, health status, and other observations. (Note: That dataset appears to contain about one-third fewer trees than the map’s count, for reasons I can’t quite figure out.) Results of the 1995 and 2005 tree censuses are also available.

Last month, colleagues at BuzzFeed News and I analyzed and fact-checked 1,000+ posts from hyperpartisan Facebook pages, and found a disturbingly high rate of fake news. Here’s the data. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the possibility that fake news influenced the election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea”. Meanwhile, renegade Facebook employees have now formed an unofficial task force to battle fake news on the platform.

https://www.propublica.org/article/hate-crimes-are-up-but-the-government-isnt-keeping-good-track-of-them

Since the 1990s, the FBI has collected data on hate crimes from local law enforcement agencies. On Monday, the bureau released data for 2015, reporting “5,850 criminal incidents and 6,885 related offenses, as being motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity.” Those numbers are based on reports from 14,997 participating agencies. On the FBI’s website, you can view and download summary tables of the most recent data. You can also download incident-specific data for 1992 through 2014 from the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data. Unfortunately, as ProPublica noted yesterday, the FBI dataset is “deeply flawed”; more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies don’t participate in the program. [h/t John Templon]

The U.S. government’s Medicare Health Outcomes Survey tracks the “physical and mental health and well-being” of Americans covered by Medicare. Each survey, currently available for 1998–2000 to 2012–2014, follows a sample of Medicare beneficiaries for two years, and asks them questions along the lines of, “In the past 12 months, have you had a problem with balance or walking?” The 2012–2014 data includes (at least partial) responses from 296,320 people.

Between October 2014 and September 2015, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration confiscated 22,196 “dangerous” items at airports, including 156 times at New York’s JFK. (Twice there, someone had placed fireworks in checked baggage.) That’s according to data obtained from the government by FOIA enthusiast Max Galka, who has also built an interactive map of the confiscations.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2016/09/12/worlds-busiest-airport-atlanta-takes-title-again/90271028/

OpenFlights.org has collected data on more than 60,000 flight routes, including 915 itineraries departing Atlanta’s Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport. (That airport was recently named the world’s busiest, for the 18th year in a row.) For each route, the dataset indicates the airline, the departing airport, the arriving airport, the number of stops, and what type of plane is typically used. The website also provides datasets on thousands of airports and airlines. Important caveat: “This data is not suitable for navigation.”

Researchers at the Vienna-based Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital have developed a dataset of historical and projected education levels for 171 countries. For five-year age groups in each country, the project estimates the percentage of people in each of several categories of educational attainment — no education, primary education, secondary education, post-secondary education, and a few gradations in between. The dataset is available to browse and download via the Wittgenstein Centre Data Explorer – look for “Educational Attainment Distribution” in the “indicators” dropdown.

After 2000’s contentious election, the National Opinion Research Center — funded by a consortium of news organizations — rigorously reviewed 175,010 Florida ballots that weren’t recognized as “valid” votes for president. In November 2001 the researchers concluded that, even with a full recount of disputed ballots, George W. Bush still would have won the state by 493 votes. The underlying data is available in several formats.

And you can also find LiDAR datasets for the United Kingdom, Spain, Finland, Slovenia, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and New York City.

To help monitor drug safety, the FDA collects “adverse event” reports submitted by patients, doctors, and manufacturers. You can download the (anonymized) reports from the FDA directly, but that dataset includes duplicate cases, and sometimes calls the same drug by different names. A group of researchers recently announced that they’ve cleaned up the data — removing duplicates and standardizing nomenclature — so that you don’t have to. The resulting dataset covers 4,245 drugs, more than 17,000 types of reactions, and nearly 5 million case reports.

The U.S. House of Representatives requires all staff to reveal all “gift travel” — i.e., “free” trips that the government didn’t pay for. The Office of the Clerk compiles those filings into a database containing each trip’s dates and sponsors.

The dataset roughly (but not precisely) overlaps with the explosions listed in the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s “Nuclear Explosions, 1945–1998” (PDF) report. Both datasets list the date and location of each explosion, the country responsible, the detonation site, and (where known) its explosive yield, among other variables. And both reports use unconventional formatting, so I’ve extracted a couple of CSVs for you.

Researchers have compiled a multi-decade database of the super-rich. Building off the Forbes World’s Billionaires lists from 1996–2014, scholars at Peterson Institute for International Economics have added a couple dozen more variables about each billionaire — including whether they were self-made or inherited their wealth. (Roughly half of European billionaires and one-third of U.S. billionaires got a significant financial boost from family, the authors estimate.)

In 2011, agriculture occupied about 22% of all land in the contiguous U.S., according to the National Land Cover Database. The NLCD classifies every 30-meter-by-30-meter chunk of land into one of 16 categories, including “woody wetlands,” “cultivated crops,” and “developed” land, at different intensities. (Alaska’s unique landscape has earned it a few additional categories, such as “dwarf scrub.”) The database is presented as raster files, so you’ll need some geospatial software to dig in.

Computational linguists at Canada’s National Research Council used Mechanical Turk to crowdsource the emotional associations of 14,182 words. For each word, participants were asked whether it was “positive” and/or “negative”, and whether it was associated with any of eight emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. The resulting Word-Emotion Association Lexicon was first published in 2010. Of the full lexicon, only two words — “treat” and “feeling” — were associated with all eight emotions. [h/t Bipul Mohanto]

Others examine the use of tone, how you say “tea”, and whether there are different words for “finger” and “hand”. [h/t Jacqui Maher]

After it became clear that the federal government was doing an awful job of keeping track of how often police kill civilians, two newspapers started counting last year. According to The Guardian’s tally, U.S. police killed 1,136 people in 2015. The Washington Post’s count — which focused on shootings only and didn’t include off-duty officers — counted 984 deaths. Both organizations provide methodologies and downloadable datasets (including demographic and geographic details): Guardian / WaPo.

Gun dealers use the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System to determine whether someone is allowed to buy a firearm. There isn’t a one-to-one correlation between these background checks and gun sales, but they’re said to be the best available proxy. The FBI publishes a PDF tallying the monthly number of firearm checks for each state and type. At BuzzFeed News, we’ve parsed that PDF into a CSV/spreadsheet for easier use.

The Mother Jones database takes narrower approach, focusing on shootings that killed at least four people in a public setting. In a New York Times op-ed, published shortly after last week’s San Bernardino shooting, the editor behind that database argues that broader methodologies don’t distinguish between a “a 1 a.m. gang fight” and “the madness that just played out in Southern California.” A Washington Post article weighs the pros and cons of broader and narrower approaches.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives publishes a searchable and downloadable licensing database. License-holders fall into eleven categories. Among them: run-of-the-mill dealers, ammunition manufacturers, collectors of “curios and relics,” pawnbrokers, and importers of “destructive devices.” The ATF’s website contains monthly and state-by-state archives. [h/t Marc DaCosta] [Correction, 2015-11-04: There are only nine categories of license-holders. The published ATF data includes only eight of them; it does not include "Collector of Curios and Relics." Thanks to @MikeStucka for flagging this mistake.]

This July, the Museum of Modern Art published a dataset containing 120,000 artworks from its catalog, joining the UK’s Tate, the Smithsonian’s Cooper Hewitt, and other forward-thinking museums. The MoMA data contains the names of the artwork and artist, the dates created and acquired, and the medium — but no images. Related: Artist Jer Thorp encourages you to “perform” the data.

The 600+ entries in this searchable, sortable database range from 3M to Amazon to Zynga, and list both paid and unpaid leave. The database, run by the women-in-the-workplace website FairyGodBoss.com, culls from published policies and employee tips. An introductory blog post provides more information.

### Porn.

Sexualitics.org is on a mission: “to contribute to human sexuality understanding through a Big Data approach.” Last year, the site posted detailed metadata on 800,000 adult videos, including titles, descriptions, view counts, and tags. It powers Porngram, an only-kinda-safe-for-work charting tool.

Prior to October 15th, the Census Bureau’s USA Trade Online tool cost $300/year. No longer. The newly-free dataset covers more than 17,000 commodities, including a category for “magic tricks, practical joke articles; parts and accessories.” [h/t Noah Veltman]

### Where do Americans spend their days?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Buena_Vista,_Florida

Most population numbers tell you where people live. But legions of Americans commute for work across city, county, and state lines. The Census Bureau’s Commuter-Adjusted Daytime Population Data accounts for these daily migrations. Manhattan’s population (non-tourist) population doubles from 1.5 million to 3 million, by far the largest influx by raw numbers. But Lake Buena Vista, Fla., takes the percentage-growth prize. The city’s entire resident population could fit in two sedans, but its “daytime population” includes 33,000 workers — including a not-insubstantial number dressed as Mickey Mouse.

This weekend, the New York Times published a front-page article on “the disproportionate risk of driving while black.” Among other findings: “officers were more likely to conduct [searches] when the driver was black, even though they consistently found drugs, guns or other contraband more often if the driver was white.” The investigation drew on several statewide traffic-stop datasets that track the race and gender of stopped drivers. The “seven states with the most sweeping reporting requirements,” in order of how easy it seems (to me) to get detailed data: Connecticut, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Maryland, Illinois, and Rhode Island.

### Data-shaming the robocallers.

https://github.com/shalecraig/telemarketing

If you can’t beat ‘em, post spreadsheets about ‘em. Earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission started publishing a dataset of complaints against telemarketers and robocalls. The FCC says the file will be updated weekly. It’s already being put to use: A clever programmer has crammed all the offending numbers into a single phone “contact” so that you can block them all at once. [h/t Shale Craig]

### Four years of rejected license plates.

https://github.com/datanews/license-plates
http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-yorkers-vanity-license-plates/

WNYC, through a freedom-of-information request to the New York DMV, obtained a list of vanity plate approvals and denials from late 2010 to late 2014. Among the denials: “RUBMYDUB,” “S5SS5S5S,” “RFLMAO,” and “CBSNEWS.” (Strangely, “NBC4” was approved. Go figure.) The files and related story were published in August, but the data are timeless.

### How often do Wikipedia editors edit?

https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/09/25/wikipedia-editor-numbers/

The Wikimedia Foundation has published a dataset enumerating monthly revision counts for every editor, across all of its wikis. The foundation is asking for help investigating a few perplexing trends. For example: Why have the number “very active editors” — those with 100+ edits per month — increased while the number of merely “active” editors have plateaued?

### What police-related data does your city publish?

https://codeforamerica.github.io/PoliceOpenDataCensus/
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/nyregion/new-york-police-will-document-virtually-all-instances-of-force.html

The Police Open Data Census, created by Code for America fellows in Indianapolis, is tracking “currently available open datasets about police interactions with citizens in the US," including officer-involved shootings, use of force, and citizen complaints. The census currently covers 36 police departments. Related: The NYPD says it will start tracking all officer use-of-force incidents — not just gunfire — next year, the New York Times reports.

### “There’s finally federal data on low-income college graduation rates—but it’s wrong.”

http://hechingerreport.org/theres-finally-federal-data-on-low-income-college-graduation-rates-but-its-wrong/
https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

The Hechinger Report casts doubt on the Pell grant graduation numbers contained in the Department of Education’s recently-released College Scorecard. Why the discrepancy? “[W]hile schools are required by law to provide the graduation rates of Pell recipients to any applicants who ask, a loophole protects them from having to report the same figures to the government.” Oof.

Sometimes, bureaucracy creates poetry. Since 1890, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names has been cataloguing, standardizing, and promulgating official names for the places we hike, swim, work, and call home. Along the way, it began publishing Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), a searchable and downloadable database containing all of its domestic nomenclature. In Alaska alone, the database lists names for 167 dams, 303 post offices, 666 glaciers, 2,704 capes, and 9,575 streams. My favorite: Confusion Creek. [h/t @emilymbadger]
